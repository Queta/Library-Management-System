Project Name: Library Management System
 
It is the course project of 'Computer Program Design (2)' in my freshman year, and it aims to realize a practical system for students and library managers to use. The course project received full marks.
 
My program realized a function of 'friendly console interface' instead of letting user type words or press Enter to see the information appear on the next line. I realized choice box and page turning and other operation usually seen in graphical interfaces. According to controlling the position of the console, changing the color of characters, and the function getch(), the whole system, including the interface, could be set up.
